## About 
**Wolf3D** is a project i made it during my student years at 1337 School khouribga (one of 42 network), This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever. 
It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.
